### 1. Emulator/Source

**Purpose:**
Our custom data factories generate realistic event streams—including synthetic device logs, financial transactions, and user profiles—that closely mimic real-world production conditions. Whether delivered to streaming or batch ingestion systems, these events rigorously test every aspect of your data pipeline.

**Key Considerations:**

- **Realism:**
  The emulator faithfully replicates both everyday activity and peak load scenarios, providing a stringent testing ground for system resilience.

- **Flexibility:**
  By generating diverse data types—such as device logs, transactions, and user profiles—the emulator supplies a versatile foundation that supports a wide range of data scenarios across both streaming and batch modes.

```plantuml
